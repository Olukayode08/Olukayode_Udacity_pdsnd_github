### Project Title
A Bikeshare Application

### Description
**This bikeshare application was created with python.**
Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B.
This project explores bikeshare data from Chicago, New York City and Washington.

**The dataset consist of the following**
* Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
* End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
* Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
* Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
* End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
* User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

**With this application Udacity students get to test their knowledge on the following concepts thought on Udacity**
* Data types and opertors
* Data Structures in python
* Control flow - Learning about conditional statements, loop, list comprehension etc.
* Functions
* Scripting
* Numpy
* Pandas

### Files used
**The various files were used to explore Chicago, New York City and Washington's bikeshare data.**
1. chicago.csv file for Chicago's  data
2. new_york_city.csv file for New York's data
3. washington.csv file for Washington's data
